# Module 4 - Functional Programming

I made this Breaking Bad character search with the help of a tutorial and a Breaking Bad API. I added some facts to the info card, so you see a little more info than the tutorial had.

It was mega informative and making this right after doing the first React guide I understood so much better how React and API's work.

All the styling came from the tutorial and I did not waste time changing that since it was not a part of the guide. 

I hope you have as much fun searching the character as I had making this :)
